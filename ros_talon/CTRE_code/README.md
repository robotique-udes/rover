README

The talonsrx package is completely based on the code from CTRE Phoenix NETMF implementation,
as is the only one that doesn't use the FRC specific firmware. The original library is available
at https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-netmf/tree/master/CTRE. In this folder you will
find copies of the files that, in my experience, are the most useful to serve as reference.

If you have any doubts about the talonsrx package -which is basically a ROS implementation of the
necessary parts of this library- feel free to contact me at javier.torresb@gmail.com

If you have doubts about the code in the Phoenix library, please contact support@crosstheroadelectronics.com
directly. In my experience, I've found their answers to my inqueries both useful and quick.
